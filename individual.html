<p>
Because the public is aware of this issue that no one in our government seems to be doing anything about, they have spread rhetoric about the responsibility of the individual to stop climate change. They brainwashed us with elementary school songs about the importance of recycling, and talk about our individual carbon footprint.  In their delusional world, consumers have enough information and choice to stop buying products that hurt our planet. In reality, I have very little bearing for what products and practices actually make an impact to reduce my carbon footprint. Maybe it seems like I’ve done a lot by making sure I recycle everything I can, but then again, since China stopped taking our waste, most cities just dump all of my carefully sorted items in a landfill. Though if I hadn’t done my own research, I wouldn’t even know that. It makes no sense to rely on me as an individual consumer to stop the largest crisis humanity has ever faced.

<p>

By putting the blame on the individual, large corporations have started a fight between people about how they’re contributing to our demise which has completely blindsided us to the fact that it is the corporation that is emitting, that individual choice is basically meaningless if it exists at all. This may seem pessimistic, to say that the individual as a consumer has no impact by changing what they do, but in fact it should be quite the opposite. No, shortening your shower and properly sorting your trash is not the solution, but that doesn’t mean you as a person can’t do anything to fight climate change. The key is in using your voice in our democracy as a voter, as a protestor, as a demonstrator to show our government that it can’t let huge corporations get away with putting profit over people any longer.
