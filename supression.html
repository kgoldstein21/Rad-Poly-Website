      <h1>Radical Action
        </h1>

<h2> Supression, Omission, and False Information
</h2>




<p>

Human-centered climate change has a long history of suppression, omission false information.
In order to continue making money, fossil fuel companies and US representatives have actively spread false information about the causes and effects of human activity on our planet.

</P>

<p>
  Exxon was fully aware of the impending climate crisis by 1977. The company even conducted its own research on the issue in order to spread false information to the public about the certainty and scale of the problem.
  Despite the records of their deep knowledge of the issue, when James Hansen testified to congress about human-centered climate change Exxon publicly said the science was still controversial.
  </p>



<h2> Active Deception
</h2>








<p>
In 1998, the American Petroleum Institute (API) internally released a memo that outlined strategies to actively deceive the public about fossil fuel’s role in climate change.
Among its outlined strategies is a plan to secretly fund five scientists that had been uninvolved in climate research until then to conduct research that would downplay our role in climate change.
One of those scientists was Dr. Wei-Hock.

<p>
  Between 2001 and 2012, Dr. Wei-Hock Soon received $1.2 million in research funding from fossil fuel companies.
   He is famous for his work on the effect of solar variability, which vastly overplays the role of the sun’s natural fluctuations in our changing climate.
   His work has been repeatedly disproved by his peers. Soon’s research contributed to the pool of doubt that policy makers and fossil fuel companies draw upon to cause public confusion about the role of human activity in changing our climate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The memo also includes plans to target the National Science Teacher Association.
    They wanted to push false evidence on students under the false pretense of presenting a balanced view of the issue.
