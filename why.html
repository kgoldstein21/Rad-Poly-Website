      <p>Many people express feeling anxiety around the future of life on our planet. It feels like a lot of the sustainability clubs in school aren’t doing nearly enough, people are telling everyone to reduce their personal consumption, shaming people for not recycling (though recycling doesn’t really exist in the United States anymore). There’s a lot of misinformation being spread about the state of the climate and how humans affect it. It feels like turning off the lights and cutting a couple minutes of your shower time is a ridiculous attempt to solve a global crisis, the true scale of which we have underestimated time and time again. 

If you’re worried about the future, if you have directly felt the effects of our changing climate, if you feel stuck about how you can help, check out the how to join page for more information about getting involved with activists around the country.
